# Tripedia [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pschlatt/Tripedia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pschlatt/Tripedia)
Tripedia - Your trips encyclopedia!  This repository hosts the backend functionality for the Tripedia app.  Both the front-end and back-end were created in a 13 day period between 5 students.  In order to create users, login users, and render routes/attractions, this application hosts a variety of API endpoints that are consumed by https://tripedia-fe.herokuapp.com/ in an attempt to help prove that "Life is about the journey, not just the destination".
